# TDS_P1_MAY25

In this submission app9.py is my final API script which will be hosted on Render web service.
API key are stored in env variable on render project setting.

1. This API using catched_emb.json (catched embedding of 1 jan 2025 to April 14 2025 posts for TDS)
2. Then it also compares the Course content titles from mardown folder and then identify relvent link to provide as a chatbot
3. Another thing this API does is it compares all post text relevent to question and creates a LLM based responce as a part of answer object of the output.
